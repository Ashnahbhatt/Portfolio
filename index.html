    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
       I’m a sales and marketing professional who loves turning strategy into results.
      My work sits at the intersection of data, customer insight, and execution—helping
      businesses grow through smarter sales processes, stronger relationships, and clear,
      measurable outcomes.
    <p>
      With experience in lead generation, CRM management, digital marketing, and
      performance analysis, I’m comfortable owning the full journey from insight to
      impact. I enjoy digging into data just as much as meaningful client conversations,
      because the best decisions come from understanding both numbers and people.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m known for my consultative selling style, clear communication, and ability to
      adapt quickly in fast-moving environments. Whether it’s managing CRM systems,
      shaping go-to-market strategies, or speaking confidently on platforms like ITV
      News and UK Radio, I bring clarity, confidence, and a strong commercial mindset.
    </p>

    <p>
      Above all, I care about building solutions that work—for customers, teams, and
      long-term business growth.
